# mspaint-remake
project started in apr '23 with the help of UoE Infpals, as part of their 2nd big project. original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/infpals/ip2023-big-project-2)

current features:
- basic interface with blank canvas and toolbox on the left, with **non-functional** menu tabs
- brush tool: a black coloured brush can be used, **one size only**
- eraser tool: simple eraser, **one size only**

a for fun project despite my very lacking knowledge on web dev, so development will be slow. hopefully i will come back to this with more features that i can think of. some proposed changes include:
- a working dropdown menu tab
- color palette
- able to change brush/eraser sizes
- implementation of other tools (thinking of starting with the **bucket** tool)
- move to a framework? (possibly react)
